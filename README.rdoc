= Neo Ruby Koans
Ruby Koans use unit testing to teach ruby basics and intermediate knowledge. 

Things worked on while practicing ruby with Ruby Koans:
- Writing solutions to standard problems with ruby (such as the greed problem and dice set)
- Refreshing and solidifying my understanding of basics of the language
